## Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)

- **Stock**: AAPL (Apple Inc.)
- **Date Range**: 2015-01-01 to 2023-01-01
- **Model**: ARIMA(5, 1, 0)
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Value  |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 25.80  |
| RMSE   | 28.91  |

---

## Portfolio Optimization

- **Assets**: AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN
- **Optimization Objective**: Maximize Sharpe Ratio
- **Constraints**:
  - No short selling (weights between 0 and 1)
  - Total portfolio weight = 100%

## Optimal Portfolio Allocation

| Ticker | Allocation (%) |
|--------|----------------|
| AAPL   | 27.84%         |
| MSFT   | 21.90%         |
| GOOG   | 0.00%          |
| AMZN   | 50.26%         |

- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.9095
